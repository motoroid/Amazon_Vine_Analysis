# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Purpose
###  The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. For this analysis, it will be determined if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.
## Results
### It was intersting that for Digital Video Games the paramets of total votes was greater than or eaul to 20 and the helpful vs total votes greater than 50% resulted in no paid votes showing up.  This was verified by analyzing the count of total votes after which was 1685; equal to the total of unpaid votes when the vine filter was applied.  After this the total 5 star unpaid was equal to 37% of the votes.

## Summary
### Unless something was done incorrectly it appears that the vine program did not create any bias for this dataset under the filtered parameters given that the paid results came up to zero.  The filter requriements did appear to be unrelated to the paid vs unpaid question and it would be recommended to follow up and see why they would have an impact.
